          <h3>Why This Matters Now</h3>
          <p>
            The City of Vanderhoof urgently needs safe, supportive homes for
            adults with developmental disabilities. Without further investment,
            adults with developmental disabilities will continue to face
            displacement, isolation and unsafe living situations. Charis
            Supportive Housing Society exists with the purpose of seeking to
            ensure that every person experience the dignity of a home, access to
            care, and the community that embraces them for the long term.

                Residents can afford about $500/month, but local rents are more
                than double.

          <h4>The Opportunity</h4>
          <p>
            Charis Supportive Housing Society is partnering with Nechako View
            Senior Citizens' Home Society as they move toward the purchase of a
            purpose-driven duplex in Vanderhoof.
          </p>
          <p>
            Once the acquisition is finalized, Charis will lease the home from
            Nechako View and lead the renovation work needed to create a safe,
            dignified, and supportive living environment for local residents who
            require consistent support.
          </p>
          <p>
            The layout already suits shared living with on-site staff, meaning
            donor support for renovations and upgrades will translate into safe
            housing almost immediately.
